## Why does this project exist?

As Steve Jobs [once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o):

> You've got to start with the customer experience and run backwards to the technology.

**Responsive images are one of the most difficult topics nowadays** for front end developers and content authors, they involve multiple features and syntaxes, but they are **required to provide a good performance to Web users**.

Most content authors should not have to learn the complex responsive images HTML syntax, how and it is used by browsers to load the right image for current viewing context.

### A Node.js package

Images Responsiver transforms plain, simple `<img src="â€¦">` HTML tags into better responsive images syntax with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

Knowing that [`<picture>` is only required for rare advanced usages](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/), **Images Responsiver should be enough for most use cases**, where the need is known as Resolution Switching.

Read [this article on Cloudfour's blog to know more of the theory](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-the-simple-way/).

### A plugin for Eleventy

Images Responsiver is [also available as a plugin](https://nhoizey.github.io/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/) for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), an awesome Static Site Generator.

It allows authors to use the simple and **standard Markdown syntax for images** â€”Â `![alt text](image.jpg)`Â â€” and yet get responsive images in the generated HTML.
